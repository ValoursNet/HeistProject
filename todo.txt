Split up Play.java into:
	Application Layer
		RandomNumberGenerator and utils
	Game Logic Layer
		AI, Collisions, Map Data
	Presentation Layer
		User Input and Rendering
		
Possibly remove slick stuff (or at least simplify usage to only a few files)
Change collision system to box, not point collision.
Get all the bullet shit out of the render. That isnt where it belongs.

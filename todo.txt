Split up Play.java into:
	Application Layer
		RandomNumberGenerator and utils
	Game Logic Layer
		AI, Collisions, Map Data
	Presentation Layer
		User Input and Rendering
		
Possibly remove slick stuff (or at least simplify usage to only a few files)
Clean up collision system (using 30 If statements cant be the best way)
	Similar to line method
	Returns how much movement is allowed
